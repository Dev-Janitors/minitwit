# Minitwit

To start the app run ``docker-compose up``. (Make sure the docker daemon is running)

Currently there is no frontend for the refactored version of minitwit. Go to ``localhost:2222/swagger``, to see and test the endpoints.

## Backend features (checked if refactored)

- [ ] Register
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Logout
- [x] Get public timeline
- [ ] Get my timeline (self and followed users)
- [x] Get users timeline (only User's posts)
- [x] Post message
- [ ] Follow/Unfollow user
